# Display_and_query_List_of_items_AngularJS
This app displays list of phoones.
We can search and sort them.

AngularJS is used to build this "Single Page Application".
XHR requests are made to a json file which contains all the information about these phones.
We can enhance the application by connecting it to MongoDB and integrate Stripe to make it an ecommerce website.

To view the result 
1.cd to the root folder
2.Run "npm install", to install the dependencies
3."node server", which starts a server on localhost:3000
